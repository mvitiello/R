    "# Working with Web Data in R\n",
    "Most of the useful data in the world, from economic data to news content to geographic information, lives somewhere on the internet - and this course will teach you how to access it. You'll explore how to work with APIs (computer-readable interfaces to websites), access data from Wikipedia and other sources, and build your own simple API client. For those occasions where APIs are not available, you'll find out how to use R to scrape information out of web pages. In the process you'll learn how to get data out of even the most stubborn website, and how to turn it into a format ready for further analysis. The packages you'll use and learn your way around are rvest, httr, xml2 and jsonlite, along with particular API client packages like WikipediR and pageviews."

This chapter will explore how to download and read in static files, and how to use APIs when pre-existing clients are available."
